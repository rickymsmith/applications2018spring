	<h1>Idea</h1>
	<p>An App that helps you decide the best outfit by outlining the style and fit of clothing.</p>
		<p>Instead of focusing on colors or brands it will be about how the clothing fits your body.</p>
	<h2>Deliverable</h2>
		<p>The deliverable will be a mockup walking the user through how to use the application</p>
		<p>I have experience creating fashion figures and I enjoy fashion</p>
		<p>Progress will mainly be metered by how far along my creation process is with the UX interface.</p>
